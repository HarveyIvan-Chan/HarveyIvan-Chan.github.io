# IEEE-754 Decimal-32 Floating-Point Converter
A simple web application that takes a floating-point decimal and converts it into its IEEE-754 Decimal-32 floating-point representation, displayed in both binary and hexadecimal form, with the option to download the result as a text file.

## Running the web app
The web app is hosted online (through GitHub Pages) and can be freely accessed on any browser through [this link](https://harveyivan-chan.github.io/).

Alternatively, since the web app contains no dependencies on any online services or databases, one may clone this repository and run the web app locally by opening `index.html`.

## Using the web app
1. Input is taken in the form of a scientific notation, with the exponent part to be represented as `^n`. So if one were to enter the value `127.0x10‚Åµ`, then they must enter `127.0x10^5` into the input text box.
2. Pressing the `Convert` button will start the conversion process.
3. Output in the binary and hexadecimal form will be displayed below the `Convert` button.
4. An additional option to download the result as a text file can be done by clicking the button `Download Output` below the displayed results.
